## Project Hours Breakdown

### Hours Calculation

**Completed Work:**
| Component | Hours |
|-----------|-------|
| Repository initialization | 0.25 |
| README.md creation | 0.25 |
| Git branch setup | 0.25 |
| Validation and verification | 0.25 |
| **Total Completed** | **1** |

**Remaining Work:**
| Component | Hours |
|-----------|-------|
| N/A - scaffold is complete | 0 |

## Development Guide

### System Prerequisites

This is a minimal scaffold repository with no runtime requirements. However, for future development, consider:

- **Git**: Version 2.x or higher
- **Text Editor/IDE**: Any editor capable of editing Markdown files

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Repo-Test-Sud
```

2. **Switch to Development Branch**
```bash
git checkout blitzy-305c8f09-15ef-4b42-97d7-9d03ecffa73c
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Verify Repository Structure**
```bash
ls -la
# Expected output:
# README.md
# blitzy/
```

2. **Verify README Content**
```bash
cat README.md
# Expected output:
# # Repo-Test-Sud
# Testing Existing and New Projects
```

3. **Verify Git Status**
```bash
git status
# Expected output: nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### Current Repository State

The repository is intentionally minimal with:
- No source code to compile
- No dependencies to install
- No tests to run
- No applications to start

This is by design as a scaffold for future development.

## Detailed Task Table

Since this is a minimal scaffold repository that is 100% complete for its current scope, there are no remaining tasks. The table below reflects the completed state:

| Task | Priority | Status | Hours | Description |
|------|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Repository initialization | High | ✅ Complete | 0.25 | Initial git setup |
| README creation | High | ✅ Complete | 0.25 | Documentation created |
| Branch setup | High | ✅ Complete | 0.25 | Blitzy branch configured |
| Validation | High | ✅ Complete | 0.25 | All validations passed |
| **Total** | - | **Complete** | **1** | - |

### Future Development Tasks (When Requirements Are Defined)

When project requirements are defined, typical tasks might include:

| Task Category | Estimated Hours | Priority | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|-------|
| Project structure setup | 2-4 | High | Create src/, tests/, etc. |
| Dependency configuration | 1-2 | High | package.json, requirements.txt, etc. |
| Core implementation | TBD | High | Depends on requirements |
| Testing framework | 4-8 | Medium | Unit and integration tests |
| Documentation | 2-4 | Medium | API docs, guides |
| CI/CD pipeline | 4-8 | Low | GitHub Actions, etc. |
