# TLS/SSL Certificates Directory
# ================================
# This directory stores TLS/SSL certificates for HTTPS support.
#
# Files to generate locally (NOT committed to version control):
#   - server.key  : Private key for TLS
#   - server.cert : TLS certificate
#
# To generate self-signed certificates for development:
#   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.cert \
#     -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
#
# Enable HTTPS by setting HTTPS_ENABLED=true in your .env file.
#
# WARNING: Self-signed certificates are for development only.
#          Use properly signed certificates from a Certificate Authority
#          (e.g., Let's Encrypt) for production environments.
#
# This .gitkeep file ensures the certs directory is tracked by git.
